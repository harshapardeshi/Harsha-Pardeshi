# Bulk-RNAseq-Analysis
## Introduction 
Bulk RNA sequencing provides a powerful way to analyze transcriptomic changes across large groups of cells. By quantifying gene expression under various experimental or clinical conditions, it helps detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and interpret biological differences between groups. These insights contribute to understanding disease biology, molecular pathways, and the discovery of new therapeutic strategies.
